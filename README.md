personal notes for classes and such

I've tried to keep things neat for most of the classes I'm in.

For past classes, some of them wouldn't compile, so I just put the offending stuff in a `\verb||` block so it would compile and the information would still be there. Not at all a good solution, but I don't need those notes anymore, just felt like sharing them.
